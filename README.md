# Software-Engineering
This repository contains material produced during the Software Engineering course taken at **Freie Universit√§t Berlin** between April and July 2025, as part of a Bachelor's degree.

The content covers the core topics of software engineering: from **requirements engineering to software design, through maintenance, quality assurance, testing, UML modeling, software reuse, and process management**.

It includes:
- all the assignments completed and submitted during the semester,
- an English version of the notes, written in LaTeX and compiled as a PDF,
- the original notes in Italian, written using Obsidian.

Everything here was created for study purposes during the course. Nothing official, just useful stuff.
